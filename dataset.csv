covered due incomplete annotation human genome Further WES cover potentially functional non coding elements including untranslated regions enhancers long noncoding RNAs although clearly defined Another drawback WES limited ability detect structural variations copy number variations translocations inversions In spite limitations WES still tool choice many researchers practical advantages allow large numbers patients screened robust fashion crucial aspect mutation discovery human genetics research WES used identifying genetic variants associated variety diseases Here discuss different categories inherited human disease methodology employed examine case Diseases inherited recessive pattern traditionally highly amenable genetic analysis due fact homozygous variants easily detectable Previously large family many affected members available pedigree analysis one would perform linkage analysis genotyping family members order identify relatively short genomic intervals presumably contained disease associated variant Direct interrogation entire genomes homozygous variants possible NGS technologies public datasets used exclude common variants less probable disease causing Identifying recessive variants especially straightforward proband product consanguineous marriage sequencing entire exome patient would likely yield manageable number rare homozygous variants studies could performed investigate functional relevance variants In one earliest reports application WES technology Bilgüvar et al ] identified recessive mutations WDR multiple Turkish consanguineous patients severe developmental brain defects Very little known WDR time subsequent genetic functional studies since validated importance gene proper brain development More recently large cohort patients similar genetic status clinical manifestation analyzed using homozygosity mapping WES data ] The authors uncovered genes previously identified disease causing demonstrating power WES ideal tool gene discovery Mendelian diseases dominant modes inheritance pose greater technical challenges genetic analysis Heterozygous variants generally difficult detect analyze due sheer number compared homozygous variants also subjected higher false positive false negative errors Nevertheless one could still design one following experiments elucidate genetic architecture underlying diseases depending availability patient cohorts effect disease reproductive fitness Familial cohort If large families disease interest available WES performed least two affected family members In analyzing results shared variants could potentially disease causing using linkage data focus variants located linked intervals would greatly reduce number variants considered A recent example approach WES study familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis FALS ] The authors recruited two large families FALS selected two affected members greatest genetic distance family WES Among rare functional variants identified tested shared variants Mendelian segregation among affected family members eventually narrowing search single common gene PFN Non familial cohort When large families disease readily available one could perform WES number unrelated patients similar clinical manifestations select genes commonly mutated patient cohort In carrying experiment important consider background mutation burden entire human gene set possible longest genes might contain highest number rare functional variants therefore appear interesting To circumvent errors analysis variant burden gene normalized using data control population In WES study pseudohypoaldosteronism type II PHAII variant burden every gene unrelated patients compared controls ] A single gene specifically enriched mutations patient set KLHL identified variants patients compared controls p value Non inheritable diseases If disease phenotype severe enough affects reproductive fitness one could hypothesize de novo variants variants emerged meiosis germ cells unique offspring directly associated disease These detected performing trio based WES unaffected parents proband variants present offspring parents called de novo variants The rate de novo mutations shown relatively stable affected primarily paternal age ] WES family quartets also carried unaffected siblings recruited simultaneously de novo mutations compared proband A series studies involving autism trios quartets recently demonstrated rare de novo mutations associated risk autism identified multiple de novo mutations SCNA KATNAL CHD implicating genes genetic etiology underlying autism ] The majority disease burden modern societies endure attributed common complex diseases These diseases typically genetic environmental causes also possess significant genetic heterogeneity making identification disease causing genes challenging Traditionally use linkage analysis families extreme disease phenotypes somewhat successful mutation discovery ] However mutations particular patients extreme phenotypes explain pathophysiology disease patients general population Large genome wide association studies common variants also employed limited success findings many studies robust explain small fraction disease risk ] As result greater attention drawn profiling rare variants allele frequencies less complex diseases Taking advantage WES technology several large scale projects launched One example project led National Heart Lung Blood Institute NHLBI discover novel genes underlying cardiovascular disorders As result sequencing exomes individuals study reported excess rare functional variants concluded large numbers subjects required attain sufficient power discover variants significantly associated disease traits ] WES yields extensive lists genomic variation many important caveats bear mind carrying analysis data In section address potential challenges investigators need consider designing performing experiments Recent improvements WES technique experimental bioinformatics pipelines reduced occurrence false positive false variant called true false negative true variant failed called variant calls substantially Currently achieve ~ sensitivity specificity exome sequencing data minimizing chance missing true variants compared analysis SNP array data data shown However mentioned previously technically challenging detect evaluate rare heterozygous variants heterozygous variant calling susceptible technical errors require higher read depth For example coverage depth e base covered independent reads assuming per base error rate homozygous variant called reads observed reference nonreference alleles respectively false positive rate However reference nonreference alleles coverage heterozygous variant called false positive rate This presents particular problem one considers uneven coverage WES resulting differential capture efficiencies across exome To achieve reliable heterozygous calling therefore necessary achieve sufficient coverage depth across entire exome minimize number bases low coverage Another challenge analysis read misalignments typical length NGS reads near less bp even paired reads subject improperly aligned large portions human genome DNA sequence highly repetitive duplicated In fact segmental duplicated regions defined intervals larger kb homology > parts genome encompass human genome ] Hence imposing rigorous filtering criteria remove reads including Phred score mapping quality score cutoffs essential The recent dramatic acceleration human population growth last several millennia resulted excess rare variants human genome variants enough time subjected natural selection ] Since identification disease associated variants consists largely assessing rare variants one must bear mind possibility variant interest could population specific necessarily disease causing This especially problematic patient cohort European specifically northwestern European descent Recent public sequencing projects Genomes Project NHLBI Go Exome Sequencing Project covered greater variety non European ethnic groups report groups harbor greater burden rare variants compared Europeans ] For example indigenous African individuals may carry times rare variants East Asian individuals may carry times variants compared individuals European descent Rare variants specific population study might easily mistaken

"Developing JSequitur Study Hierarchical Structure Biological Sequences Grammatical Inference Framework String Compression Algorithms Grammatical inference methods expected find grammatical structures hidden biological sequences One hopes studies grammar serve appropriate tool theory formation Thus developed JSequitur automatically generating grammatical structure biological sequences inference framework string compression algorithms Our original motivation find grammatical traits several cancer genes detected string compression algorithms Through research could find meaningful unique traits cancer genes yet could observe interesting traits regards relationship among gene length similarity sequences patterns generated grammar compression rate In formal language theory language simply set strings characters drawn alphabet alphabet terminal set symbols When consider biological sequences simply language context formal language theory treating DNA RNA protein sequences strings alphabets four nucleotides amino acids grammatical inference method based formal language theory applied ] Nevill Manning Witten ] pioneered attempt produce context free grammarof biological sequences automatic way This task formalized problem finding smallest context free grammar recursively replacing repeats new symbol The algorithm builds hierarchy phrases forming new rule existing pairs symbols including non terminal symbols For example consider string "" atattattatt "" simplest way represent string context free grammar following Grammar > S → atattattatt The frequently occurring sequence string "" "" occurs four times Thus introducing new nonterminal symbol A creating new rule yields following modified grammar Grammar > S → AAtAtAt A → grammar consists start symbol e S two terminal symbols e

terminal symbols e S A B three production rules e S → ABBB A → B → At By applying three production rules replacing occurrence nonterminals left hand side production rule appear right hand side string

evolutionary biology tested answered metagenomic research For example Fuhrman et al ] tested latitudinal gradient biodiversity one widely recognized patterns macroscopic taxa marine bacteria recently taxonomic functional distinction bacteria desert compared nondesert biomes investigated cross biome comparison using shotgun metagenomics ] Varied definitions converge two main categories targeted metagenomics shotgun metagenomics depending purpose target materials This review offers overview tools databases widely used targeted shotgun metagenomics particular emphasizing metagenome sequences generated recent next generation sequencing NGS technologies The recent development sequencing technologies enabled us assess much deeper layers microbial communities generating tons nucleotide sequences lower costs NGS technologies revolutionized field microbial ecology allowed researchers reach true level diversity closely depth sequencing There various applications using NGS platforms ranging single gene targeted sequencing whole genome sequencing shotgun metagenome sequencing Details principles applications NGS technique already reviewed elsewhere ] The first NGS platform pyrosequencer GS generated Mb per run read length bp average A recent version pyrosequencer GS FLX Titanium advantage NGS techniques especially S rRNA gene based surveys produces around ~ Mb per run longer read length bp sufficient cover partial hypervariable regions S rRNA Illumina sequencing produces many reads cheaper price accurate accuracy > platforms accuracy ] somewhat limited certain fields due relatively shorter read length bp early versions However Illumina became popular since gradually improved readable lengths e bp MiSeq More recently Pacific Biosciences released new sequencing technology PacBio RS Oxford Nanopore Technologies introduced GridION MinION devices allow single molecule sequencing much longer read length However improvements necessary use practice due high intrinsic errors PacBio around GridION ] Since first launch NGS platform novel sequencing technologies developed continuously rapidly As result massive sequence data produced NGS technologies accumulating unflagging rate However computing power development algorithms needed deal huge datasets efficiently keeping speed data production For example access sequence data still hampered unsuitable data storage systems short read archive SRA many early papers accompanied data deposition public databases Repositories big enough ready allow increasing volume upcoming sequence data data must deposited standardized manner In addition shortage data storage space confounding submission formats characteristics produced sequence data pose another problem processing For instance shorter read length inevitable limit high throughput sequencing barrier sequence assembly relatively higher rates sequencing errors compared previous Sanger methods also make hard recover genuine sequences Targeted metagenomics refers metagenomic approach surveys genes genomic regions particular interest targeted methods activity sequence driven studies ] Sequence driven targeted metagenomics normally conducted PCR based directed sequencing environmental genomic DNA Ribosomal RNA genes e g small subunit SSU ] large subunit LSU ] used taxonomic marker genes identifying microbial species The characteristics highly conserved variable regions allowed accurate taxonomic identification made easier design primers targeting whole taxa interest Although taxonomic resolution S rRNA gene sufficient delineating taxa species strain level cases ] SSU ribosomal RNA S rRNA used widely standard marker gene prokaryotes For last decades molecular methods assess microbial diversity focused rRNA genes using probe based approaches fluorescent situ hybridization microarray fingerprinting methods molecular cloning Some still use review focus mainly sequence data generated recent NGS techniques Microbial community profiling using taxonomic marker genes e g S rRNA gene commonly uses operational taxonomic unit OTU based approach sequence based species definition microbes still vague current public databases still reach full extent microbial diversity despite massive sequencing efforts This OTU based approach generally accepted microbial community studies based environmental samples Over last years pyrosequencing major source generating amplicon metagenomics data among NGS platforms due capability producing relatively longer read length Therefore bioinformatic analysis tools dealing sequence data developed tailored pyrosequencing results More detailed information algorithms processes step found several reviews ] In part introduce recent tools databases provide brief explanations work course analysis workflow Table ] The first part analysis NGS generated data starts filtering noise sequences Most metagenomic studies based single multiple gene amplicons used pyrosequencing due advantage producing longer read lengths currently available denoising algorithms also developed purpose The denoising process per se remove actual sequences keeps abundant information erroneous sequences retaining representative reads Several denoising algorithms suggested far PyroNoise ] implements flowgram clustering method denoising tools Denoiser ] DADA ] Acacia ] use sequence abundance information denoising process Similarly single linkage preclustering used performing formal OTU clustering reduce noise sequences generated PCR sequencing errors ] It first ranks sequences order decreasing abundance rarer sequences within certain threshold merged original abundant sequences Once denoising additional quality control processes completed chimeric sequences removed dataset Chimeras artificial recombinants two parental sequences normally formed prematurely terminated fragments reanneal template DNA PCR amplification ] These artificial molecules make difficult differentiate original sequence recombinants resulting overestimation level microbial diversity environmental samples ] Once chimeras generated sequenced need identified removed dataset using bioinformatics tools However detecting chimeras still challenging breakpoints take place position NGS platforms generate shorter lengths sequences making hard differentiate source parents insufficient taxonomic information Several elegant algorithms tools suggested preferentially identifying chimeric sequences high throughput datasets These tools include UCHIME ] ChimeraSlayer ] Perseus ] Decipher ] All tools except ChimeraSlayer use sequence frequency information detect chimeras assuming chimeric sequences less frequently represented given dataset normally amplified sequences There algorithm detect chimeras perfectly date known UCHIME outperforms algorithms least short NGS reads ] Although still several limitations detecting chimeric sequences formed hybridization closely related organisms tools listed work well SSUs LSUs validations necessary internal transcribed spacers functional genes The next step following chimera detection OTU clustering essential process community analysis sorts sequences closest matches gives taxonomic meaning clustered group Sequencing errors chimeras clustering algorithms great influence quality OTUs ] There generally two ways suggested generating OTUs One alignment based clustering alignment free clustering method Sequence alignment done either aligning query sequences pre aligned reference sequences ] using pairwise multiple sequence alignments ] It known alignment quality significant impact OTU clustering results ] Alignment quality varies depending gene loci parameters used sequence alignment incorporating secondary structure information generally improves OTU assignment least S rRNA gene sequences ] The nearest alignment space termination NAST algorithm ] used successfully microbial ecology profile based alignment tool SINA aligner ] based partial order alignment infernal ] using consensus RNA secondary structure profiles recently introduced However currently method algorithm automatic alignment almost perfectly quality achieved manually Alternatively alignment free methods broadly used picking OTUs Commonly used alignment free tools UCLUST ] CD HIT ] ESPRIT Tree ] UCLUST CD HIT implemented sorting processes OTU clustering sorting sequences order decreasing abundance e UCLUST decreasing length e CD HIT ESPRIT Tree uses average linkage based hierarchical clustering algorithm There tools implement homopolymer collapse option minimizing homopolymer errors reads CLOTU ] SCATA http scata mykopat slu se CrunchCluster ] TBC ] However tools currently applicable reads fundamental limitation able detect real sequence differences appearing homopolymer regions SCATA suggested another OTU picking approach using reference sequences query sequences together clustering process OTU assigned taxonomic identity reference sequence reference sequence belongs cluster A taxonomy dependent approach recently proposed alternative OTU clustering approaches ] This method two major advantages OTU clustering First direct taxonomic assignment query sequence tolerant sequencing errors OTU picking process assignment process less affected mismatches insertion deletion errors sequencing errors known generate many spurious OTUs It also helps prevent massive loss erroneous still taxonomically meaningful sequences Second enables researchers perform standardized community analysis based single assignment rule There truly universal primer set difference primer sets makes difficult compare datasets different primer sets amplify differing variable regions within S rRNA genes catch partial body whole true community On hand taxonomy supervised method circumvent problem directly assigning sequences closest relatives using full length reference sequences This approach also facilitates cross comparison meta analysis across versatile microbial community studies A caveat low taxa coverage current marker gene databases offsets advantage approach hinders application practice failing find closest matches known members due primarily lack close relatives given database Another limitation relatively lower assignment accuracy precision short NGS reads compared full length sequences It generally known even longer Titanium reads able identifiable high confidence scores best genus level ] even genus level classification doubted ] However problem soon overcome high quality sequences added databases For example EzTaxon e benefits using artificially defined species names defined based combinatorial evaluation using phylogeny pairwise similarity unclassified sequences taxonomic levels It endows taxonomically meaningful information unclassified sequences rather remaining unknown environmental sequences Moreover recent updates slightly improved database coverage adding error free reads selected using abundance information http eztaxon e ezbiocloud net Identifying individual sequence great importance microbial community analysis taxonomic information

scalable analyze large number clones tremendous amount reads per clone needs screened The latter strategy genuine random shotgun approach took essentially approach NGS based metagenome assembly

several reasons make binning nontrivial job One reasons NGS technologies generally produce short reads When applying shotgun sequencing complex microbial communities found soil seawater freshwater gastrointestinal tract sequencing coverage reach level required make assembly practically useful even current deep sequencing methods The majority reads remains unassembled As result majority reads

previous observations hinting functions Peg apoptosis These include regulation Peg p mediated apoptosis muscle cachexia wasting response tumor load induction Peg response hypoxic conditions ] Taken together results support idea Peg tumor suppressor potential connection autophagy At molecular level imprinted genes Peg domain code two different types proteins ubiquitin specific protease Usp zinc finger proteins Peg Zim Zim Zim Zfp According recent studies USP might also tumor suppressor given observation USP required stability Claspin key protein DNA damage checkpoint ] This quite intriguing since DNA hypermethylation PEG DMR always regarded epigenetic abnormality affecting expression PEG USP although PEG DMR controls genes Thus would interesting test whether outcome DNA hypermethylation manifests regulation PEG PEG USP together Among four zinc finger proteins within Peg domain Peg gene studied far protein level According recent studies PEG binds many genomic loci DNA binding protein transcriptional repression activity ] It well known many zinc finger proteins including Peg domain repress downstream genes interaction KRAB associated protein KAP SET domain containing histone methylase HK SETDB ] Thus predict PEG may also repress downstream genes SETDB KAP driven HKme According recent studies several placenta specific gene families de repressed mouse embryos Peg null mutant allele yet gene families usually repressed HKme mediated mechanisms ] Thus result supports idea PEG controls downstream genes HKme mediated mechanisms At molecular level several genes within Peg domain also predicted function ncRNA genes Fig Among genes APeg quite unique RNA gene due following reasons First well conserved among mammals ] Second antisense transcript gene localized UTR another proteincoding gene case Peg ] Third APeg expressed hypothalamus highly regulated response osmotic challenge ] Given special circumstances predicted APeg may designed control expression Peg Consistent prediction vitro studies demonstrated APeg potential regulate mRNA protein levels Peg ] Although mechanistic basis observed regulation needs investigated vivo functions APeg likely connected Peg The Peg domain displays unique features also shares several features imprinted domains First domain structure well preserved mammalian evolution seen domains This makes sense prediction imprinting transcription Peg domain likely controlled group shared cis regulatory element case Peg DMR As part conserved genomic interval many ECRs found localized within middle kb region also predicted enhancers individual imprinted genes within Peg domain Fig Coordinating potential enhancers individual promoters may needed since ECRs likely shared among individual imprinted genes As ICR Peg DMR might responsible coordinating task According situation observed H Igf imprinted domain ICR functions enhancer blocker another transcription factor CTCF controlling accessibility shared enhancer H Igf ] Interestingly ICR H Igf domain also unusual cluster CTCF binding sites similar localization tandem array multiple YY binding sites within Peg DMR ] Although ICRs similar many ways roles ICRs likely different This prediction based result YY YY binding sites display enhancer blocking activity ] One plausible role YY might linking tethering long distance enhancers corresponding target promoters ] As described earlier ECR interacts bidirectional promoter Peg Usp This long distance interaction linking ECR bidirectional promoter may mediated YY YY binding sites within Peg DMR Fig A similar scenario also possible ECRs found within Peg domain warrants series systematic careful investigations near future Overall seen domains conserved genomic structure Peg domain makes sense presence co regulation Peg DMR mechanisms governing Peg domain ICR likely unique based involvement transcription factor YY Second overall functional outcomes Peg domain similar observed domains controlling fetal growth rates maternal caring behaviors ] In particular consistently demonstrated functional studies Peg locus ] Despite similar outcomes organismal level potential function imprinted gene likely unique molecular cellular levels For instance Peg codes DNA binding protein repression activity molecular level inhibits cell growth tumor suppressor cellular level Yet Peg regarded growth stimulator organismal level since regulation Peg usually results reduction body size The functional outcomes Peg seem somewhat contradictory cellular organismal levels This quite unique compared imprinted genes encoding proteins different biochemical properties paternally expressed insulin like growth factor Igf maternally expressed insulin like growth factor receptor Igfr The phenotypic outcomes pair ligand receptor overall similar cellular organismal levels ] Igf stimulates cell growth thus higher levels Igf result bigger body size Igfr derives exactly opposite phenotypes Igf inhibiting cell growth thus Igfr results smaller body size As proposed earlier conflicting phenotypes Peg cellular organismal levels could explained following manner ] Peg might involved programmed cell death development neuron cells specifically set neuron cells producing growth suppressors The absence Peg could result overgrowth neuron cells excessive amount growth suppressors cellular level causing smaller body size organismal level Although remains tested feasible since many imprinted genes highly expressed neuroendocrine system hypothalamus responsible controlling body size growth hormones ] In regard interesting note another paternally expressed DNA binding gene Zac zinc finger protein regulating apoptosis cell cycle arrest also shows similar conflicting outcomes growth suppressor cellular level growth stimulator organismal level ] Since Peg Zac growth suppressors cellular level genes quite often identified tumor suppressors Although overall functional contributions Peg domain similar domains organismal level detailed function imprinted gene predicted unique cellular molecular levels Third Peg domain also contains several ncRNA genes seen imprinted domains These ncRNA genes include Zim Zim Zfp rodent lineage Fig These ncRNA genes unique due following reasons First ncRNA genes relatively recent evolutionary origin ancestral genes identified easily sequence similarity corresponding protein coding sequences It currently unknown whether ncRNA genes process becoming pseudogenes already adapted ncRNA genes functions Regardless maintained transcriptional activity quite long time given accumulation mutations disrupting ORFs suggesting gene products ncRNA transcription part Peg domain If already adapted ncRNA genes examining sequences provide clues regarding protein coding sequences become ncRNA genes evolution Thus ncRNA genes Peg domain might provide unique opportunity understand evolutionary paths mammalian genes In regard relevant note mammalian X chromosome inactivation specific transcript Xist represents another well known case proteincoding gene become ncRNA gene ] Second functions ncRNA genes lineage specific rodents since original genes ncRNA genes still protein coding genes mammals This level lineage specific change observed imprinted domains This might related fact Peg domain part large zinc finger gene family known vulnerable genomic rearrangements including deletion duplication ] Also functional redundancy afforded zinc finger gene family might allowed members drift away proteincoding sequences without severe phenotypic consequences Overall structurally conserved genomic interval Peg domain might allowed several protein coding members adapt ncRNA genes seems quite different evolutionary patterns observed imprinted domains The Peg domain shows many similar features seen imprinted domains include conserved genomic structure allowing long distance transcriptional regulation ICRs well allele specific DNA methylation subsequent monoallelic expression In past two decades unusual features studied extensively using imprinted domains model loci At time Peg domain displays several unique features studied imprinted domains These unique features thus worthwhile study future increase understanding genomic imprinting imprinting related human disorders First YY YY binding sites appear major player Peg domain In particular tandem array YY binding sites selected function Peg DMR yet molecular basis function still unknown One possibility would multiple YY binding sites might involved setting DNA methylation oogenesis The possibility would YY binding sites might required transcriptional control Peg adjacent imprinted genes Targeting YY binding sites mutagenesis experiments provide clear direct answer regarding vivo role multiple YY binding sites Second Peg recognized potential tumor suppressor time without progress understanding According recent studies Peg may play major role regulating autophagy endothelial cells intriguing due following reasons Peg highly expressed organs regarded endothelial cell rich tissues placenta autophagy also regarded part apoptotic pathways Thus characterizing potential roles Peg autophagy worthy project immediate future Third Peg domain appears evolved rapidly mammalian evolution As consequence several members kb domain changed protein coding ncRNA genes It well known ancestral state given genomic interval cannot easily reconstructed due many changes accumulated long evolutionary times In case Peg domain kb genomic structure well preserved ancestral structure readily reconstructed comparing Peg domains several mammals Thus careful sequence analyses provide immediate insights regarding evolutionary paths mammalian genes especially undergone transformation protein coding non coding RNA genes Overall directions worthwhile pursue near future likely provide additional exciting information regarding Peg domain regulated

ChromHMM chromatin states follow linguistic grammar merely form short fragments motifs DNA signatures continuous longer fragment sequences Our simulation studies showed chromatin states possessed strong Markov properties DNA sequences could even predicted naïve Bayesian classifier However model could biased n gram analyses conducted two cell lines Thus follow preliminary study ENCODE datasets

ChromHMM blocks human genome initially dissected nucleosome resolution bp units analyzing BED files ChromHMM individual unit assigned one dominant chromatin state The process explained detail

chromStart starting position feature chromosome chromEnd ending position feature chromosome state chromatin states numbered For example chromatin state Gm shown bottom Fig block chr chr _Heterochrom lo whereas chromatin state K block chr chr _Insulator We attempted build comparative nucleotide frequency profiles detect Markov property Thus became critical devise functional annotation framework generalized different cell types To design good predictive models building Markov chain atlas human genome modified original BED files dissecting ChromHMM blocks BED file bp units When size dissected unit near ChromHMM boundary less bp discarded unit whereas size dissected unit greater bp rounded bp unit For example original Gm block Fig chr chr block size bp dissected two units bp blocks chr chr

nucleotide frequency tables units bp convenient way build general framework test various Markov properties simply combining bp frequency tables various ways specific purposes Dissecting blocks uniformly made possible combine annotations spread different BED files single integrated BED file ] shown Fig Each row integrated BED file shown bottom Fig composed eighteen entries chromosome number

annotated two times state Weak_Enhancer one time state Txn_Transition one time state Txn_Elongation times state Weak_Txn throughout original BED files whereas occurrence count numbers remaining chromatin states unit zero states Filtering highly variable bp units After integrating BED files defined variability count chromatin states given bp unit number states counts occurrences non zeroes define compare observed consistency chromatin state given genomic position across epigenomes For example chromatin state variability count chr – block Fig would four four non zero states e whereas chromatin state variability count chr – block Fig would one one non zero state We could use variability count statistics maximum likelihood decision rule create optimal classification Markov model uniform priors assumed bp units stable chromatin state used In way highly variable bp units different chromatin states frequently switched states across different tissues cell types could eliminated training Markov transition tables Our rationale behind compared highly variable bp units bp units less frequently changed would show strong Markov property When human genome dissected bp unit originally units see Table Among units variability counts chromatin states units one indicating cell lines annotated state bp units variability counts chromatin states units two It also indicates cell lines annotated either two states bp units This means bp units strong preferences certain dominant chromatin state dominant state bp unit frequently annotated chromatin state among chromatin states This provided good heuristic insight designing new Markov models study Thus possible assign one two dominant chromatin states bp units entire human genome Building fifth order Markov models After assigned dominant chromatin state bp unit frequency counts used build fifteen initial transition tables fifth order Markov models ] For example uniform fifth order Markov chain specified vector initial probabilities P Xn Xn Xn Xn Xn components well matrix transitional probabilities P Xn | Xn Xn Xn Xn Xn size These tables used build global Markov chain classifier explore rank sub optimal

Markov chain models aπiπi ＋ transition probability P x π α π ∏ α π π By trial error rebuilt newer Markov chains iteratively analyzing variability count chromatin states given bp unit eliminating highly variable bp units training Fig summarizes process building Markov chains When human genome dissected bp units originally units By trial error rebuilt newer Markov chains eliminating highly variable bp units training We finally excluded bp units showed two different chromatin state signatures training transition tables Thus result based units accounted approximately entire human genome However determining whether remaining highly variable bp units genome would show Markov property beyond scope paper By process found inactive chromatin states highly constitutive marked epigenomes For example state Hetero_Chromatin state covered average reference epigenome excluded considering variability count chromatin states We also excluded units transcribed state showed promoter enhancer signatures Mostly profiled bp chromatin states built new transition tables training bp blocks chromatin variability less containing least one active state These fifteen chromatin states merged six broad states Promoter Enhancer Insulator Transition Repressed Inactive Our final transition tables Promoter Enhancer Insulator Transition Repressed state excluding inactive states built bp units respectively As Markov chains could used Naive Bayes classifier calculated sequence bp unit maximized Markov models We defined correctly predicted unit one predicted result matched one dominant chromatin states broad state As means proving Markov property directly investigated whether sequence based Markov chain models chromatin state discriminating power necessary identify different chromatin states The samples stratified according chromosomes strictly non overlapping training testing sets A total bp units trained bp units tested prediction accuracy At time reverse complements sequences considered building Markov models since backward Markov chain could show similar properties solutions Table shows result precision Promoter states precision Transcribed states Enhancer states These percentages obtained adding units predicted correctly dominant state bp units divided number testing units broad group By estimating prediction accuracy chromatin states infer Promoter states showed reasonable Markov property Repressed state seem display Markov property units related Enhancer states states tissue specific whereas related Transcription states states highly constitutive In short report provide interpretable biological meanings statistically defined dominant state yet Therefore study considered computational perspective thus preliminary work Still

interoperability Inter platform interoperability among platforms fundamentally function ability exchange data consisting text associated annotations This means data must mutually “ understandable ” either directly via trivial conversion must possible appropriately utilize data platforms within constraints respective architectures To address considerations following sections consider two levels interoperability pair platforms “ data level ” model schema interoperability “ process level ” triggering reacting events interoperability At data level investigate degree information preserved lost converting data one format another mapping data one schema another By “ annotation model ” short model refer basic building blocks e g spans relations attributes largely independent domain annotation takes place By “ annotation schema ” refer domain specific categories ranging linguistic categories part speech named entities dependency relations domain specific categories proteins habitats Table shows point point comparison annotation formats three platforms Fig shows coreference annotation example represented original formats three platforms illustrating difference PubAnnotaton ↔ INCEpTION The PubAnnotation model defines two primary annotation types “ denotations ” connect text spans annotations “ relations ” connect annotations INCEpTION defines three types annotations “ spans ” “ relations ” “ chains ” associated number “ features ” The two data models largely share important annotation concepts e g denotations spans relations However PubAnnotation currently allow features associated denotations relations therefore accommodate INCEpTION ’ LAPPS ’ features proposed add “ attributes ” PubAnnotation model cf Fig Other elements INCEpTION ’ annotation model require non trivial solution example INCEpTION defines “ chain ” type annotation represent sequentially connected linguistic elements e g coreferences While PubAnnotation model define element corresponding INCEpTION ’ chains represented set denotations sequentially connected relations Fig INCEpTION requires schema defining annotation types features Since PubAnnotation model explicitly define information type annotation stored convention retaining INCEpTION ’ schema information must introduced We considered two options store annotation type "" obj "" denotation relation introduce attribute special

WSEV strict requirement string URI used specify annotation type This flexibility allows trivial “ syntactic ” mapping PubAnnotation JSON format LIF This also true mapping UIMA schema assuming type names follow Java naming conventions However semantics PubAnnotation annotations e POS tags named entities etc usually specified therefore many cases necessary apply LAPPS Grid tools annotation

annotations reference types WSEV apply solution previously discussed INCEpTION LAPPS Grid type information preserved PubAnnotation using "" obj "" element The LAPPS Grid separates annotations produced different tools different “ layers ” “ views ” supports inter layer dependency via ID linking In contrast PubAnnotation groups annotations text produced different projects single “ collection ” PubAnnotation provides support inter project dependency see Fig B instead PubAnnotation allows project included multiple collections The differences structuring multiple annotations text reflects difference focus two frameworks workflow development system LAPPS Grid primarily concerned way annotations created across multiple processes repository annotations PubAnnotation focuses making easy

must addressed achieve PubAnnotation LAPPS Grid interoperability The first requirement PubAnnotation allow retention LIF metadata information lost round trip transaction two platforms The second concerns semantic interoperability mapping annotation types annotation schemes problem cross platform interoperability general remains open problem part Semantic interoperability often achieved mapping names defined one scheme names denoting linguistic phenomenon however case PubAnnotation use definition anchored names URIs mandatory therefore annotation sets use arbitrary names In cases manual intervention required determine inter platform correspondences LAPPS Grid ↔ INCEpTION The WSEV defines ontology annotation types attributes may referenced within LIF annotation documents via unique URIs Objects produced consumed NLP components LAPPS Grid pipelines mapped corresponding terms WSEV enables ensuring given component use annotations produced previous component To maximize generality across NLP components WSEV designed higher level linguistic annotation objects upon considerable consensus practice e g "" Token "" "" Sentence "" "" Constituent "" "" NamedEntity "" etc explicitly specified thereby accommodating annotation objects produced consumed NLP tools More specific identifiers part speech tags constituent labels entity types prescribed reference defined list used given annotation given metadata view annotation lives The LIF format also allows adding number user specified feature value pairs annotation required given application may used ignored subsequent tools pipeline appropriate While principle user define custom annotation types INCEpTION set built types conform DKPro Core type system While DKPro Core WSEV differ details generally significant overlap annotation types cover Therefore order make productive use LAPPS Grid services necessary perform format conversion well mapping INCEpTION annotation types types defined WSEV This means custom annotation types defined INCEpTION may readily usable LAPPS Grid services On INCEpTION side presently concept grouping annotations provenance Thus ingesting LAPPS Grid data INCEpTION information

Similarly INCEpTION allow multiple annotations type latest LIF view containing particular annotation type included Again means represent information multiple LIF views involving annotation type INCEpTION would demand creating special mechanism accommodate information round trip two platforms desired In addition able transport data platforms also important platform fulfill specific role cross

LAPPS INCEpTION set conventions encode platform specific metadata using PubAnnotation model An example minimal manual configuration interoperability INCEpTION LAPPS user needs specify annotation type feature carrying predicted labels To meet user ’ needs sufficient access labels full mapping annotations produced LAPPS Grid required Additionally identified several places including metadata interoperability among three platforms improved For example PubAnnotation could provide support storing schema information thereby removing need INCEpTION LAPPS Grid use conventions thus facilitating conversion annotations platforms At time identified several area obstacles interoperability among three platforms remain attributable two major sources Differences “ overall organization ” annotations opposed structure annotation content e PubAnnotation organization annotation sets projects LIF organization views accompanying metadata INCEpTION organization UIMA hierarchy objects Difficulty mapping annotation names necessarily corresponding object feature scheme We suggested number ways address first issue primarily finding ways retain information specific one representation others restored round trip platforms However required platforms exchanging annotations use data – example one platform might use annotation identifiers Additional work necessary identify extent critical real world use cases address The second issue concerns semantic interoperability pervasive problem harmonizing linguistic annotations one obvious universal solution exists time It interesting set basic

Direct consumer genetic testing advantages pitfalls Conventional genetic testing process clinicians take samples patients clinically needed send laboratory genetic testing discuss test results patients Direct consumer DTC genetic testing different conventional genetic testing consumers learn DTC genetic testing TV commercials internet store advertising request tests performed DTC companies choice If conventional genetic testing clinician centric framework DTC genetic testing consumer centric one Normally saliva mouth cells obtained scratching inside one ’ mouth cotton swab sent DTC company The company isolates DNA sample conducts genetic test The test results analyzed proprietary house programs genetic profile report various phenotypes sent consumer The test items test report may vary depending needs consumer well operational characteristics company Conventional clinician centric tests aimed diagnosing treating patients ’ diseases mainly limited genetic diseases cancers Consumer centric DTC tests also carry genetic tests diseases additional emphasis biometric life related concerns obesity nutrition skin hair loss ancestry life cycle Therefore aim DTC genetic testing determine consumers ’ propensity phenotypes genetic predisposition tested diseases preventive purposes rather diagnosis treatment diseases The cost DTC genetic testing varies company company roughly range – US dollars DTC genetic testing generally covered insurance The advantages DTC genetic testing described follows ] First DTC genetic testing may provide opportunity consumers recognize importance genetics diverse phenotypes including diseases If test results indicate consumer genetic predisposition certain disease phenotype interest may take proactive steps improve health It easy access genetic information DTC testing require approval clinicians insurance companies Moreover DTC genetic testing generally less expensive faster genetic testing performed hospitals The sample normally collected non invasively gathering saliva scratching inside one ’ mouth cotton swab instead drawing blood performed hospital Lastly data consumers ’ genetic tests collected valuable databases help research related fields shown papers published andMe one leading DTC genetic testing companies United States ] Nonetheless DTC genetic testing important drawbacks ] DTC genetic testing often provide conclusive results whether consumer develop disease Most genetic tests performed DTC companies limited major genetic variants related phenotypes interest leads poor discriminatory power Diseases generally affected many genetic variants — words polygenic In addition genetic factors disease incidence influenced environmental lifestyle factors including age sex race nutrition exercise stress Thus DTC genetic testing guarantee consumer high genetic risk score suffer certain disease Instead indicates one genetic propensity disease If one affected favorable environmental factors lifestyle beneficial disease one may develop disease despite high genetic risk On contrary consumer low genetic risk may get sick lives disease prone environment lifestyle factors increase susceptibility disease For example andMe conducts APOE genetic test relation Alzheimer disease The average likelihood developing Alzheimer disease carriers relevant allele twice high people carry However everyone APOE e gene develop Alzheimer disease APOE e gene confers resistance Alzheimer disease likewise guarantee one never get Alzheimer disease Consumers sometimes experience stress receive unexpected test results especially results related serious diseases cancer ] It recommended results cancer genetic testing examined consultation clinicians since genetic test results related cancer may significant impacts consumers There also many different genetic variants related specific cancer available DTC genetic testing For example three genetic variants examined genetic testing BRCA BRCA conducted andMe U S Food Drug Administration approval However many mutations BRCA BRCA known affect risk breast ovarian cancer Furthermore family history known explain – cancer cases A wide variety factors including age sex nutrition exercise race disease history hormonal factors reproductive factors affect development cancer Consumers may make decisions inaccurate non deterministic DTC results take actions damage health without appropriate consultation clinicians Lastly often lack scientific evidence genetic tests carried DTC companies consumers ’ genetic information may used purposes without approval might even stolen due inappropriate security measures The discovery genetic variations diseases phenotypes interest e g weight hair loss intelligence etc quickly paying Clinical applications focused predictive models disease Previously disease predictions made using genetic variants showed significance genome wide association studies GWASs basis polygenic score PGS calculated Most predictions resulted poor discrimination imprecision Predictive models gradually starting use genetic variants GWASs discovering genetic variations consequence using increased number samples recently developed predictive models take account genome wide variations calculating genome wide polygenic score GPS In study using GPS body mass index people highest score category obesity prevalence rate four times higher categories ] Thus GPS method yielded better predictions ever The worrisome factor relates reporting genetic test results The results DTC genotyping clearly communicated consumer particular clear guidance given regarding tests indicate illness health cannot show special emphasis fact tests cannot diagnosis disease Consumers may make decisions based inaccurate non deterministic DTC results may even take actions damage health without appropriate consultation clinicians DTC companies therefore inform consumers limitations test results encourage consumers consult clinicians taking action Many concerns mentioned shortcomings DTC genetic testing remain pending At point guidelines provided American College Medical Genetics Genomics DTC genotyping follows ] First genetic testing interpretation results complex processes Thus genetic testing performed laboratory inspected appropriate agency CLIA program United States In addition genetic experts clinical geneticists genetic counselors handle requests consumers provision test results They protect consumers improper informed consent procedures lack pre test descriptions incorrect genetic test items inappropriate precautions medical practices resulting misinterpretation test results Second consumers informed DTC company test results cannot DTC genotyping Third DTC company explain unexpected unrequested results may come genotyping Consumers also informed unforeseen consequences affect also family members Fourth DTC company inform consumer scientific basis upon genetic test conducted If technical general public understand explained way facilitates easy understanding Fifth consumers receive following information part explanation personal information protection see results consumer ’ genetic test measures taken protect genetic information sample processed used genetic test results subsequently affect life insurance disability insurance owns genetic information produced whether genetic information provided third parties DTC genetic testing provides consumers opportunity learn genetic profiles related phenotypes interest convenient less expensive manner Furthermore list test items increase predictive accuracy improved related research continues progress rapidly However many concerns previously mentioned shortcomings DTC genetic testing remain pending While DTC companies try compensate shortcomings extent possible regulation DTC companies established appropriate agency safeguard consumers abuse DTC genetic testing ,protein
Direct consumer genetic testing Direct consumer DTC genetic testing controversial issue although Korean Government considering expand DTC genetic testing Preventing exaggeration abusing DTC genetic
